### Node Up! Server Side JS FTW

We decided to change of plans this session! We will eventually test our app but realized that this will be a lot easier if we have a back-end up and running (which we need to test, too!). So lets get down into some server side JavaScript!

Forget about Java, Rails, PHP, ASP.NET or whatever else you are used to, it is time meet NodeJS!

Like last time we will do some live coding covering:

* What's Node and why should I use it?
* Basic server side programming
* [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) 101
* CommonJS modules
* NodeJS Web Frameworks
* Web applications with [Express](http://expressjs.com)
* Persistent storage with [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org) using [MongoSkin](https://github.com/kissjs/node-mongoskin)
* User registration and login
